Let me clarify the differences between Elastic APM and Fleet Server:

**Elastic APM (Application Performance Monitoring)**:
- Monitors application performance
- Tracks application-level metrics
- Provides insights into:
  - Response times
  - Transaction traces
  - Error tracking
  - Code-level performance details
- Focuses on understanding application behavior and performance
- Supports multiple programming languages
- Part of Elastic Observability stack

**Fleet Server**:
- Central management system for Elastic Agents
- Handles agent configuration and deployment
- Key responsibilities:
  - Centralized agent management
  - Secure communication with agents
  - Distributes configurations
  - Enables large-scale agent orchestration
- Provides:
  - Centralized policy management
  - Simplified agent enrollment
  - Scalable agent deployment
- Part of Elastic's centralized management ecosystem

**Key Differences**:
- APM monitors application performance
- Fleet Server manages and orchestrates Elastic Agents
- APM provides performance insights
- Fleet Server handles agent configuration and deployment

They serve different purposes in the Elastic ecosystem:
- APM is about performance monitoring
- Fleet Server is about agent management and configuration

Would you like me to elaborate on either of these components?
